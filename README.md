# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
What I enjoyed most about this project was figuring out where the code needed proper semantics. The code worked but with the proper semantics now it looks as good as it works.
I took the existing code and optimized it for search engines. I made it web accessible for a wide range of socio economic statuses. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
YOU will find that the website now meets accesibility standards
THE HTML follows a semantic structure
THE styling is independent
ALL of the image elements have alt attributes
THE headings fall in order
THERE is a concise and descriptive title element
```
